Warewulf v4.6.2 was intended to be a regularly-scheduled minor release in the
v4.6.x series, but its release was delayed to include a preview of the ability
to provision node images to local disk, an alternative to provisioning to
volatile memory.

- (preview) support for provisioning to local disk
- improvements to the REST API
- removal of gRPC API infrastructure
- other misc. documentation and bug fixes

Significant changes are detailed in the [release
notes](https://warewulf.org/docs/v4.6.x/release/v4.6.2.html). Additional changes
may be listed in the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/warewulf/warewulf/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
